    content: `**Penitential Act**

I confess to almighty God, and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned, in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done, and in what I have failed to do. Through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.

Therefore, I ask Blessed Mary, ever virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me, to the Lord our God.

**Prayer to Guardian Angel**

I ask you, O my Guardian Angel, my holy patron, St. Peter and St. Mary Magdalen and all the saints of God. Intercede for me a sinner, assist me that I may be able to declare my sins to the priest, fully, humbly, and with a contrite heart.

Send forth God's light into my soul, and reveal to me all those sins which I ought to confess at this time. O most merciful Jesus, be merciful unto me a sinner.

Amen.

*1 Hail Mary*`

    content: `O my God,
I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,
and I detest all my sins,
because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell;
but most of all because they offend Thee, my God,
Who are all good and deserving of all my love.

I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace,
to confess my sins, to do penance,
and to amend my life.

Amen.`
